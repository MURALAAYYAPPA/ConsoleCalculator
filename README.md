# ConsoleCalculator
# Java Console Calculator
NAME : MURALA AYYAPPA
## Project Overview

This is a simple **Java Console Calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations:

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

The calculator takes user input through the console using the **Scanner** class and runs inside a loop until the user chooses to exit.

## Tools & Technologies

* Java (JDK 8 or above)
* IDE: VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA CE / Eclipse
* Terminal or Command Prompt

##  Features

* Menu-driven interface
* Handles divide-by-zero errors gracefully
* Supports continuous calculations until exit
* Demonstrates **methods, conditionals, loops, and console I/O**
